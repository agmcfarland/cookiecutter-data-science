--------

# General idea

notebooks: formal analyses. These can be run to replicate all data and analyses generated. Numbers indicate the order each notebook can be run. For example 0-my_analysis must be run before 1-next_analysis because the numbering indicates that 1-next_analysis may use data generated be 0-my_analysis. 

src: libraries and scripts to generate data.

# Organizing analyses

All Folders are subdivied by the notebook name.

**Notebook analysis**

`notebook/0-first_analysis.rmd`

**Interim data**

`data/intermin/0-first_analysis`

**models**

`models/0-first_analysis`

**Helper R libraries(s)**

`Rlib/0_first_analysis.R `

**Helper python libraries (x at start because filename can't start with a number)**

`lib/x0_first_analysis.py`
